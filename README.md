# Visualizing HSL color distributions

This code can be used to visualize the distribution of colors.  It plots
histograms of hue, saturation, and lightness respectively.

It takes one input file: `rgb.npy`, which contains a 256 × 256 × 256 NumPy
array of RGB frequencies in the NumPy format.  In other words, `rgb[r][g][b]`
should be the number of occurrences of the color `(r, g, b)`.

Once the input file is in place, the plots can be generated by running `make`.
