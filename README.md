# Visualizing HSL color distributions

This code can be used to visualize the distribution of colors.  It plots
histograms of hue, saturation, and lightness respectively.

It takes one input file: `rgb.npy`, which contains a 256 × 256 × 256 NumPy
array of RGB frequencies in the NumPy format.  In other words, `rgb[r][g][b]`
should be the number of occurrences of the color `(r, g, b)`.

Once the input file is in place, the plots can be generated by running `make run`.

## loadpngs

This tool takes a set of PNG images and gathers the following statistics for
them:

  - Averaged RGB value for every pixel.
  - Distribution of hue, saturation, and lightness respectively.

To build the tool, run `make loadpngs`.

As example, suppose you want to gather statistics on 3 images of size 800×600:
`input1.png`, `input2.png`, and `input3.png`.  To do this first run the
following command:

~~~sh
./loadpngs in 800 600 stats.dat input1.png input2.png input3.png
~~~

This will create a file called `stats.dat` that tracks the statistics.  You
can call this command as many times as you like with a pre-existing
`stats.dat` to add more images.  (Note that if you add the same image multiple
times, then it will be weighted higher!)

After gathering the statistics, we distill the data via:

~~~sh
./loadpngs out 800 600 stats.dat avg_rgb.png hsl_dist.dat
~~~

This creates `avg_rgb.png`, which is the shows the average RGB values as an
image, as well as `hsl_dist.dat`, which contains the HSL distribution and can
be visualized via `./plot_hsl hsl.dat`.
